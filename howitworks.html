	<h2>Prep Co. offers a revolutionary buffet dining experience.</h2>
	<h2>Here's how it works:</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Come on in and grab a tablet if you want to track what you're
		eating. Each tablet is linked to the scale next to each buffet
		item.</li>
	<li>Snag a tray if you're going to have many plates to juggle
		&mdash;we guarantee you will!</li>
	<li>When you find something tasty, put the paper serving dish on the
		corresponsing scale and weigh out your food. The calories and <br> macros
		will display on your tablet as the weight changes!</li>
	<li>When you get to the amount of food you want, hit the "ok"
		button on the tablet. Viola! The stats are added to your meal.</li>
	<li>Get as much food as you want and watch how your stats change
		without all the calculating work on your end.</li>
	<li>Eat up!</li>
</ol>
	<h2>That's how our restaurant works, but how does <i>food</i> work?</h2>
